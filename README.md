This binding project includes three articles "We Need Graphic Design Histories That Look Beyond the Profession", "The Modernist Grid", and"Typography Is A Grid". The use of grids and typography has been a core of the evolution of modern art and design. Both of these elements have played profound roles in shaping the visual language of the 20th and 21st centuries and have influenced modern art and graphic design history. This is the reason why I chose “The Mordenist Grid” and “Typogrphy is a Grid” and how these three articles connect with each other.
The inspiration from the Bauhaus movement and the work of Piet Mondrian, this article explores their central contributions to the development of modern design principles. Both the Bauhaus school and Mondrian's artistic approach were key to shaping the aesthetic and functional language that continues to influence design today. 
The style of Bauhaus and Mondrian is characterized by geometric forms—such as squares, circles, and triangles—along with clean lines and primary colors. In my design, I incorporate primary colors like yellow, blue, green, and red in the navigation bar and article title to create a cohesive color palette. I also use lines to separate different elements, reflecting the simplicity and structure of their style. To further illustrate this, I include an example of Mondrian's work on "The Modernist Grid" page, helping the audience better understand the article’s concepts.
