                    <h2>Redefining Graphic Design History: Expanding Beyond Professional Boundaries for a More Inclusive Future</h2>
                </aside>
                <section class="page1">
                    <p>Graphic design history is, generally speaking, a history of professional practice. In text books, at conferences, and for college courses, design historians and educators explain the development of the industry through the example of pivotal figures, canonical works, and dominant styles. And yet, visual communication is not only a professional domain. It's an active cultural practice shared by all. What would it look like to expand the scope of history beyond professional boundaries, and what might we gain from doing this? </p>
                    <p>What we now call graphic design was originally associated with trade labor like printing and commercial art. At the turn of the twentieth century, the field began detaching from these roots. WA Dwiggins coined the term “graphic designer” in 1922, but it wasn't widely used until after World War II. By the 1960s and '70s, graphic design was becoming a subject for academic study in more and more institutions across Europe and the United States. By the 1980s, the emergence of the personal computer and desktop publishing put graphic design tools into the hands of anyone who could afford them. It was around that time that a movement of educators and practitioners saw a need to create a history to elevate graphic design above an amateur's knowledge, decouple the industry from trade disciplines, and position the field as an equally important cultural player alongside architecture, fashion design, and the fine arts. It was within this imperative to professionalize graphic design that graphic design history made its debut. </p>

                    <p>To distance the professional from both the layperson and the blue-collar worker, the rhetoric of problem solving proved to be useful. In a 1985 article published in the AIGA Journal of Graphic Design, historian Philip B. Meggs distinguished a designer's skill from a print laborer: </p>

                    <blockquote>A layout man was a pair of hands doing what he was told…no one would consider asking him to solve a problem, or even ask him to think about the problem.</blockquote>

                <section class="page3">
                    <p>In that same article, Meggs made history's legitimating power plain:</p>
                </section>
                <section class="quote2">
                    <blockquote>If graphic design is to succeed at casting off the antiquated notion of 'commercial art' taking a rightful place beside architecture and painting as a major visual expression of our culture, the 'history void' must be overcome.</blockquote>
                </section>
                <section class="page4">
                    <p>Like other early graphic design historians, Meggs was also an educator, who saw a link between teaching history and training new professionals. For these educators, developing a formalist graphic design history that analyzed the visual and material aspects of objects was the best way to solidify this link. But history meant more than that. It also meant having a legacy for contemporary design that offered students role models, a set of values, and a sense of professional worth. </p>
                    <p>This was an effective strategy for elevating graphic design's cultural cachet. Graphic design is now an in-demand college major and it is more visible in popular media. But since the profession was (and still is) mostly white, upper middle class, and solidly situated within Eurocentric ways of knowing and being, when it comes to role models and value systems, the formalist graphic design history we inherited doesn't offer much diversity. As a result, it delimits our understanding of who made visual communication in the past and what kinds of practices existed beyond the industry's gaze.</p>
                    <p>The field's most pressing imperative today is no longer professionalization; it's to make design practice a responsible part of building equitable, sustainable futures. But our knowledge of past practices—limited as it is to design “professionals”—carries over to the present.  The field now needs to overcome its disciplinary reclusiveness as well as its social exclusions if it is to maintain any future relevance. A more expansive history of what graphic design has been could offer a more expansive view of what it could be.</p>
