          <p>This binding project include three articles,"We Need Graphic Design Histories That Look Beyond the Profession", "The Modernist Grid", and"Typography Is A Grid". As a discipline and cultural practice, graphic design has long been influenced by foundational structures such as modernist grids and layout principles. The modernist grid is not just a formal design tool. It reflects a unique worldview that prioritizes reason, order, and abstraction. Typography is not just about fonts which is itself a grid, a system that conveys and constrains meaning through its structure.</p>
          <p>The aethetic of this project is from Bauhus and Mondrian's style which is remind from the article. The style is followed them which I use clean lines for the article, primary color for the nav bar and title. I advocate reimagining the history of graphic design that beyond professional boundaries, considering the intersection of design with politics, technology, culture, and daily life. By exploring the relationship between the evolving roles of grids, typography, and design, we can better understand that graphic design not only shapes visual communication, but also plays a critical role in shaping the way we perceive and navigate the world around us. The design history we choose to narrate should reflect these interconnected complexities, including a broader and more inclusive perspective that views design as a dynamic force rather than just a professional practice.</p>

          <p>This publication was designed and typeset by Ziwei using VS Code and Github. The typefaces used throughout this work are Didot and Minion, carefully selected for their legibility and aesthetic alignment with the themes discussed within. The layout follows principles inspired by the modernist grid, exploring the intersection of form, function, and content.</p>
